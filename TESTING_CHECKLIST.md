# Dataset Explorer Testing Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist ensures no regressions occur when refactoring the Dataset Explorer layout from sections to tabs, and when adding the dashboard feature.

## Before Refactor (Baseline) - Section Layout

### Data Loading
- [ ] Dataset name and description display correctly
- [ ] All tables render with correct row counts
- [ ] All columns with charts are visible

### Filter Propagation (Cross-Table)
- [ ] Direct filter on table shows blue badge (e.g., "2 filters")
- [ ] Related tables show propagated filter badge (e.g., "+1 linked")
- [ ] Transitive relationships show hop count (e.g., "+1 linked (2-hop)")
- [ ] Filtered row count updates correctly
- [ ] Percentage badge shows correct filtered %
- [ ] Unrelated tables show no propagated filters

### Filter Presets
- [ ] "Save Filter" button appears when filters exist

- [ ] View preferences restore on page load

### Persistence (URL Hash)
- [ ] URL hash updates when filters added
- [ ] URL hash clears when all filters removed
- [ ] Filters restore from URL hash on page load

- [ ] No overflow or layout breaking
- [ ] Colors are consistent and accessible

### NOT Operator Support

- [ ] Switching tabs shows correct filtered data
- [ ] Filter badges visible on non-active tabs (if applicable)
- [ ] All persistence (localStorage, URL) still works
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] No visual regressions
